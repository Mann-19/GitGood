Git Good - Get better at git 🌳

Version Control, Without the Confusion.

A streamlined, interactive guide designed to help developers master Git through real-world scenarios and jargon-free documentation.

🔗 Live Demo (Replace with your actual deployment link)

🎯 The Mission

Let's be honest: Git is scary.

Most tutorials teach you the commands (git add, git commit), but they rarely teach you the workflow. Beginners often struggle with questions like:

"What do I do if I pushed to the wrong branch?"

"How do I fix a bug without breaking the main app?"

"I just merged and everything is broken. How do I go back?"

I built Git Essentials to bridge the gap between "memorizing commands" and "understanding the lifecycle of code". It is designed to be a panic button and a guidebook for developers who want to feel confident using version control.

✨ Features

1. 🚀 Real-World Workflows (Scenario-Based)

This is the core of the project. Instead of reading a dictionary of commands, you follow step-by-step guides for specific daily tasks:

Getting Started: Creating repos, cloning, and first pushes.

Feature Development: Branching strategies and keeping main clean.

Collaboration: Handling PRs and code reviews.

Problem Solving: Fixing merge conflicts and recovering lost work.

2. 📚 Reference Documentation

Structured learning tiers for when you just need to look up syntax:

Beginner: Core commands (Init, Clone, Push, Status).

Intermediate: Team collaboration (Fetch, Merge, Stash).

Advanced: Power user tools (Rebase, Reflog, Cherry-pick).

3. 🎨 Zero-Friction UI

Single File Architecture: The entire app lives in one index.html file.

No Installation: No npm, no servers, no databases. Just open it in a browser.

Clean Design: Minimalist interface focused on readability.
